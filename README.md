ColumbusEgg4Delphi is a simple  to use framework to correctly write business logic in Delphi "RAD style" applications. 

# Why ColumbusEgg4Delphi?
- Forms and datamodules are free of BL code.
- Provides a single point for the BL code
- You can do unit tests; BL can be unit tested using in-memory datasets.
- You can still use the RAD approach to design you forms
- If your data comes from an application server, you can fill in-memory datasets (or virtual dataset) and still use the same BL.

## Very Important!
- Columbusegg4delphi can be used also in legacy applications to improve their architecture at very low cost.
  - Just create a columbus module for each dataset and move there all the events related code. It is an incremental approach; you can change it one dataset at time.
